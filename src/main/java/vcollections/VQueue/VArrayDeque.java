/*
* ArrayDeque
The ArrayDeque class implements a double-ended queue (deque) that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends efficiently. It is part of the java.util package.

Key Features:
Resizable Array: Internally, ArrayDeque uses a resizable array, which means it can grow or shrink as needed.
No Capacity Limit: It doesnâ€™t have a fixed capacity, so it can grow as needed.
Fast Operations: It supports constant-time operations for adding, removing, and accessing elements from both ends of the queue.
Not Thread-Safe: It is not synchronized, so it is not thread-safe. If you need a thread-safe deque, consider using ConcurrentLinkedDeque.
